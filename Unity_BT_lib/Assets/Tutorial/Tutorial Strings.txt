//STRING TUTORIAL
public class TutorialStrings : MonoBehaviour {

	//In the previous tutorials, we sent recieved array of bytes. Today we will send/read string.
	//In this tutorial I'll try to convince you that sending/recieving an Array of bytes is enouph to achieve anything.
	//How is that? well, Computers can only understand numbers. 
	//Everything you deal with is simply a sequence of bits (0s and 1s), or in our case a sequence of Bytes.

	//So, any string of charachters can be viewed as a sequence of numbers. And there're many differnet numerical representations of a string. 
	//One example is the ASSCII code. 

	//For example the ASCII code of the charachter 'A' is the number 65, and the the charachter 'B' is 66, and 'C' is 67.
	//So if you want to send ABC in ASCII, you simply send the sequence {65, 66, 67} which is what we did last time.

	//So lets try send the string "Hello World!".



	BluetoothDevice deviceA;




	void Awake() {

		deviceA.MacAddress = "00:A0:C9:23:C4:41";


		deviceA.connect();


	}


	void Update () {

		if(deviceA.IsConnected)
		{

			//So how do we do that.


			//We want to convert our string to an array of byte.
			byte[] byte_sequence = System.Text.Encoding.Default.GetBytes("Hello World!");

			deviceA.send(byte_sequence);//that's it.





		}


	}

	//NOW LETS read data from our remote device, that we called deviceA.
	// Reading is simply done in the Update method again. 
	// We are going to read whatever data available from our remote device each frame.
	//And lets assume that we are just reciving a sequence of bytes, for simplicity.

	//SO, Again, we sent sequence of bytes and we are reading a sequence of bytes, we will deal with strings later.
	void Update2 () {
		//lets test if deviceA is connected
		if(deviceA.IsConnected) {
			//And now lets see if there's data at this frame
			if(deviceA.IsDataAvailable)
			{
				//now we are ready to call the read() method, which will return an array of bytes that represent a recieved sequence of bytes
				byte[] recived_byte_sequence = deviceA.read();

				//Now you can do whatever you want with the variable 'recived_byte_sequence' which will contain your sequence of bytes.
				//print it or use it to move some objects in your scene.

				//I think by this you covered almost everything.
			}
