This demo just introduce away for you to split data into packets (like lines) via this library. 
If you are not using string to communicate then this will ease the process of splitting data while keeping bit rate steady.

Note : 'HighRateTerminal.cs' script is already attached to the 'InfoController' gameobject in the scene.
